    <h1>Bài Tập CSS Cơ Bản</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>What is CSS ?</h2>
    <p style="color: blue;">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.</p>
    <p style="color: red;">With CSS, you can control the color,font, the size of text, the spacing between elecments, how elecments are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to br used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more !</p>
    <p id="heading"><b>Tip</b>: The word <b>cascading</b> maens that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elecments within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elecments within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)</p>
